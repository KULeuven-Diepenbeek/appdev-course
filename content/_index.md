### Good-to-know

What you should know before starting this course:

- Knowledge of **object-oriented** software development.
- Knowledge of the **Java** programming language.

What you should have learned after completing this course:

- **The ecosystem** and life cycle of a mobile (Android-based) app and how to tackle the development.
- The role of the **different components** in app development and being able to choose one over the other depending on the context. 
- Basic knowledge of the **Kotlin** programming language.
- Basic knowledge of the technical **Android API**. 
- **Unit testability** of mobile applications.
- Basic knowledge of **multi-platform possiblities** in the app development world. 
- drawing up a **project plan**/analysis for mobile development projects.

### Course planning

See the menu to the left. This course is worth `3.0` ECTS points, hence it will be divided into 12 chunks (weeks) of `1.5h` contact moments each. Extra coaching sessions will be planned if required. 

The course lies in the _second semester_ of the _second year_ and has quite a bit of overlap with other software-related courses happening at the same time, specifically [**Software Engineering Skills**](https://kuleuven-diepenbeek.github.io/ses-course/) (SES). During the SES lessons, we'll get to know design patterns and unit testing, which will also be applied in this very course. 

### Evaluation

- No formal exam planned.
- An android-based project which will have to be defended orally to motivate the taken design and implementation decisions. Open questions will be asked to gauge the knowledge level of the student. 

### More learning material

See the section "Extra" in the menu or in the links above. Each section will contain a "More learning material" part at the bottom of each page linking to supplemental bits and pieces for the curious student.
