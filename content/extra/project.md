### Minimum requirements

Every App should at minimum contain the following:

1. At least three fragments _or_ activities;
2. At least one data storage/request system;
3. At least one master/detail using a `RecyclerView`;
4. At least one `Intent`;
5. At least one menu option;
6. At least one data signal to be used (GPS, Camera, accelerometer, ...);
7. At least one extra feature you can freely choose. For instance:
    - Authentication through Google's Play Store or [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/?pli=1)
    - Sharing data between apps using a `ContentProvider`
    - Etc... See [links](/extra/links) for more inspiration on what's possible.

Also remember to adhere to the _Android dev best practices_ mentioned througout this course, such as:

- Responsive design (do not hardcode `px` but use `sp` or `dp`)
- Unit tests to test and verify your code and app
- Security by design: think about permissions and privacy in advance
- Etc...
